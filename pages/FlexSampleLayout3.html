              <p>
                When you look back at 2020, what do you think you’ll remember most about it?
                For me, it will be the lost momentum.When the year began, it looked like it 
                would be the Year of Matt (take that, “Summer of George”!). TravelCon was 
                gaining a reputation as a “must attend” event in the industry, this website
                was on track to have its best year yet, and I was finally going to build a 
                life for myself in Austin: I joined social clubs, took cooking classes (and 
                even one on gardening), and signed up for volunteering</p>

              <p>
                A number of years ago I went on holiday to a beautiful part of Portugal. 
                We stayed in a converted farmhouse in the middle of a national park. The 
                farmhouse was in a valley. We arrived in the evening when the birds were 
                just starting to roost. It was still warm and the air smelled sweet with 
                pollen. You could hear the hum of crickets. A small river flowed through 
                that valley. We opened a rickety gate and crossed a small wooden bridge. 
                As we walked along the narrow path that led to our house I had a clear 
                vision of what my morning routine would be like for the next fourteen days.
